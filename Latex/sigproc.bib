abstract = {Exposure to elevated particulate matter (PM) pollution is of great concern to both the general public and air quality management agencies. At urban traffic intersections, for example, pedestrians are often at a higher risk of exposure to near-source PM pollution from traffic while waiting on the roadside or while walking in the crosswalk. This study offers an in-depth investigation of pedestrian exposure to PM pollution at an urban traffic intersection. Fixed-site measurements near an urban intersection were conducted to examine the variations in particles of various sizes through traffic signal cycles. This process aids in the identification of major PM dispersion patterns on the roadside. In addition, mobile measurements of pedestrian exposure to PM were conducted across six time intervals that correspond to different segments of a pedestrian’s journey when passing through the intersection. Measurement results are used to estimate and compare the cumulative deposited doses of PM by size categories and journey segments for pedestrians at an intersection. Furthermore, comparisons of pedestrian exposure to PM on a sunny day and a cloudy day were analyzed. The results indicate the importance of reducing PM pollution at intersections and provide policymakers with a foundation for possible measures to reduce pedestrian PM exposure at urban traffic intersections.}

keywords = {Spatio-temporal noise pattern, Road traffic noise pollution, Noise exposure, Noise and health, Karachi},
abstract = {We studied the spatial and temporal patterns of noise exposure due to road traffic in Karachi City, Pakistan, and found that levels of noise were generally higher during mornings and evenings because of the commuting pattern of Karachi residents. This study found the average value of noise levels to be over 66dB, which could cause serious annoyance according to the World Health Organization (WHO) outdoor noise guidelines. Maximum peak noise was over 101dB, which is close to 110dB, the level that can cause possible hearing impairment according to the WHO guidelines. We found that noise pollution is not an environmental problem reserved for developed countries, but occurs in developing countries as well. For this reason, steps might be required to reduce noise levels caused by road traffic.}
