 \section{Conclusion}
During these four vehicular experiments, data from over 2300 vehicles was collected at the intersection at the University of Bremen, Germany, of which 95.53\% were private vehicles. Through the expansion of the overall data set, this data can be used in future works, such as training mobility models or vehicular traffic research. With that, the aim of providing real-world data on traffic was successfully achieved. \newpage
