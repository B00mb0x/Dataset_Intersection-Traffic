\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Background}
Scientific interest in traffic remains high. Due to rising numbers of registered cars in Europe \cite{acea_report} there is a big number of studies on congestion management \cite{5940493}\cite{8070077}, airborne particulate pollution\cite{HE2021115931} and noise pollution \cite{MEHDI201197}. %Also in communication networks mobility plays a crucial role, for example opportunistic networks rely heavily on mobility models for simulation \cite{OppNets2021}.

The need for open data sets is high, but the supply is low. The aim of this publication is to provide a high quality data set with real world data. This can be used to train neural networks, to test mobility models and for other traffic related research topics. It shall reduce the need of collecting one's own vehicular traffic data, which can be a time intensive process.

In the following sections this paper explains the data collection methods and gives a broad overview over the collected data.
